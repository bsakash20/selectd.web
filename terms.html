            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Last updated: January 21, 2026</p>

            <p>Welcome to selectd. By using our application, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them
                carefully.</p>

            <h2>1. Using our Services</h2>
            <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. Don't misuse our Services. For
                example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface
                and the instructions that we provide.</p>
            <p><strong>Voice Assistant:</strong> Some features, such as voice commands and speech-to-text interaction,
                rely on your device's native operating system services (Apple Speech or Google Speech). Your use of
                these features is subject to the respective terms and privacy policies of Apple Inc. or Google LLC.</p>

            <h2>2. Your Content, Files, and Local-First Privacy</h2>
            <p>selectd allows you to store data about your job applications, including notes, contact details, and files
                (such as resumes). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that
                content.</p>
            <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Since selectd is a "Local-First" application, all your data and files are
                stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to your data. You are solely responsible for
                maintaining backups of your information and ensuring your device is secure. Uninstalling the app will
                permanently delete all locally stored data unless previously backed up.</p>

            <h2>3. Subscriptions and Selectd Pro</h2>
            <p>Some features, including Advanced Analytics, Unlimited Exports, and Higher Data Limits, require a paid
                subscription (Selectd Pro).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payments:</strong> All payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play
                    Store.</li>
                <li><strong>Trials:</strong> If a free trial is offered, you must cancel at least 24 hours before the
                    trial ends to avoid being charged.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong> You are responsible for managing your subscriptions and cancellations
                    directly through your device's App Store account settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Liability and Professional Disclaimer</h2>
            <p><strong>No Professional Advice:</strong> Selectd provides career organization tools, salary negotiation
                templates, and data-driven insights for informational and organizational purposes only. We do not
                provide legal, financial, or professional career placement advice. We do not guarantee job offers,
                salary increases, or any specific career results.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> When permitted by law, selectd will not be responsible for lost
                profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive
                damages.</p>

            <h2>5. Business Uses of our Services</h2>
            <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms.</p>

            <h2>6. About these Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect
                changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. Your continued
                use of the app after a change to the terms constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
